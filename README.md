This repository is a work-in-progress for my bachelor’s thesis focused on the verification of control algorithms. The project includes the design and verification of three automotive models—cruise control, vehicle suspension, and engine control—using MATLAB. PID controllers were designed and their performance verified through grid point analysis and predictive control methods. The project is ongoing, with further refinements and testing in progress.
